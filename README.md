# 🧠 Leader_ai

An experimental **Python-based AI project** that includes a starter application (`app.py`) and some data files. This repository is currently minimal and designed as a foundation for building AI-driven logic, models, or tools.

* **data/**: directory for storing your source data or training files. ([GitHub][1])
* **app.py**: main script — likely contains the core logic of your AI workflow. ([GitHub][1])
* **requirements.txt**: lists Python packages needed to run the project. ([GitHub][1])

## ▶️ Usage

To run the main application:

```bash
python app.py
```

> 🔹 This will execute the core logic defined in `app.py`.
> 🔹 Modify or expand the `data/` directory and application logic to suit your AI use case.
